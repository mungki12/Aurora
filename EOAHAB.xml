            <h4>An Elf and an Orc Had a Little Baby</h4>
            <p> Instead of choosing a race, you choose 2 parentages, and an upbringing.</p>
            <p>Your birth parents might be two humans from Phandalin. Or they might be a kobold and a gnome who fell in love and had you- but through a tragic chain of events, you ended up being raised by sea elf pirates just off the Sword Coast. </p>
            <p>There is room for both stories...</p>
            <p> Each parentage entry includes parentage traits: innate characteristics passed on to you. The following items appear among the traits of most parentages.</p>
            <p><strong> I, II, III...</strong><p> Some of the birth parent options are listed with a roman numeral. These denote variants that may come from the same parentage.</p>
            <p><strong>Size</strong></p> Based on the parentage, you may select medium or small to determine your size.</p>
            <p><strong>Age</strong> By default, the lifespan of a player character in the DnD multiverse is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end. Some parentages have the Short-Lived or Long-Lived trait, which can lengthen or shorten the typical lifespan, but usually only if the same trait is inherited from both birth parents.</p>
            <p><strong>Speed</strong> By default, your speed is 30 feet. Choosing certain parentage traits, such as those of elves, dwarves, or halflings, may increase or reduce your speed. </p>      
            <p><strong>Traits</strong> Unless specified by a trait’s description, a trait’s benefits, abilities, and bonuses do not stack. If you inherit two traits of the same name, you only add it to your character sheet once unless otherwise stated.</p>        
            <p>For ease of character creation, these options use the rules in the second book.</p>

            <p>One of your birth parents is a worker abeil. Your wings make a powerful droning noise, and you produce nectar that can fully nourish you and others.</p>
            <p><strong>Buzz</strong> You can flap your wings fast enough to create a droning noise. All creatures within 60 feet that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier. On failure, a creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and falls unconscious until they take damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap the unconscious creature to consciousness. On a success, the target only takes half damage and does not fall unconscious. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p><strong>Nectar</strong> You can devour food equivalent to 1 ration and regurgitate it as up to 10 servings of sweet nectarlike paste. You can store this nectar in any container that holds liquid. A serving of nectar provides enough nourishment equivalent to one day of rations. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p><strong>Demonic Reflexes </strong>Your Armor Class increases by 1.</p>
            <p><strong>Natural Armor </strong>When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p>

            <p><strong>Restricted parentage</strong> Due to having demonic appendages, any parentage that would also change the your lower half are restricted.</p>

Each creature within 10 feet of you that can see the light must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The DC for this saving throw is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p>You must maintain concentration for the duration, as if concentrating on a spell. If your concentration ends, affected creatures are no longer frightened by this trait.</p>
            <p>Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

		<description><p>Dryads typically act as guardians of their woodland demesnes, or at minimum, their own tree. They work with other sylvan creatures to defend their forests. Unicorns, treants, and satyrs live alongside them, in addition to the druids who would protect the dryads’ homes.</p>          
            <p>Dryads are innately magical. They speak with plants and animals. They can teleport from one tree to another, luring interlopers away from their groves. They also know a handful of useful spells.</p>
            <p>Some dryads immediately confront any intruder who strays into their copse or forest. Others who are more reclusive or curious watch interlopers from the trees. A dryad struck by the beauty, personality, or skill of a stranger might investigate more closely. A few even form romantic unions, temporarily or for a lifetime.</p>
			<p>The children of such unions are mixed dryads. They look much like their non-dryad birth parent, but they might smell of the forest, be followed by small beasts and birds, have a green thumb, or literally have green skin. They might also see in the dark,have a way with people and animals, or be blessed with sylvan magic.</p>
            <p>Mixed dryads aren’t necessarily bound to a tree, like their dryad parent. Some, however, voluntarily undergo a ritual that intertwines their fate with that of a tree.</p>

		<description><p>A person with only one dwarven parent is known as a half-dwarf. Due to their relatively short and stocky frame, all half-dwarves walk slightly slower than their size suggests, though they don't seem very burdened carrying heavy loads. One other trait they all share is an ability to see in the dark.</p>          
            <p>Other than that, differences abound. Some half-dwarves can consume vast quantities of alcohol and even a little poison with few to no adverse effects. Others are naturally tough and can take quite a beating before succumbing to their wounds. Those descended from gray dwarves have latent magic. And those with a mountain dwarf birth parent are naturally strong.</p>

About half of half-grung inherit poison glands, which are localized to a specific area of their bodies but can be used to apply venom to weapons.

			<p><strong>Illusory Appearance</strong> You cover yourself and anything you are wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes you look like a creature of your general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if you take a bonus action to end it or if you die. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, you could appear to have no claws, but someone touching your hand might feel the claws.

      <p>A beam of pale blue light forming a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide flashes out from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw.
